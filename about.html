        <h4>Our History</h4>
        <p>Throughout our history we have been known to draw things out
           because we do bill hourly. Despite this facade that until now our clients
          knew nothing about, we still win a majority of our cases by keeping our legal opposition
          in court by filing needlessly unneccessary motions to the point it becomes unaffordable to them
          and thus come to a settlement even if they shouldn't. </p>
      </li>
      <li class="aboutbox">
        <span class="numberbox">2</span>
        <h4>Our Work</h4>
        <p>With the exception of giving the judge a handjob, we do everything from elder law to money laundering.
          We take pride in what we do even if it's wrong, but it's always wrong in the clients best interest.
          No matter who we're up against the opposition always get the shit end of the stick.</p>

        <span class="numberbox">3</span>
        <h4>Philanthropy</h4>
        <p>Ok let's not kid ourselves here. Any charitable endeavors that we do it's mostly in our best interest.
          We give money to baseball teams and ALS and all that crap to not only get tax write-offs but to also develop a
          jovial and benevolent PR image. I mean we are lawyers after all and the number one thing we love more than anything is
          using the law to our advantage to secure more capital.</p>
